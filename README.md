# FlipXO

This project is a tic-tac-toe game, that 2 players can play on their phones (be it Andoid or IOS) by putting the phone on the table and 
sitting on the opposite ends of the phone. The text can be read from both sides, and it allows the users to switch the colour of their used characters, start and restart the game.
