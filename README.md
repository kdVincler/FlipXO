# FlipXO

This project is a tic-tac-toe game, that 2 players can play on their phones (be it Andoid or IOS) by putting the phone on the table and
sitting on the opposite ends of the phone. Controlls are available from both sides. Starting and restarting a game is handled by buttons on either side of the game board. There is also a button to manually trigger a colour scheme change (i.e. lightmode and darkmode, but the application also automatically detects the theme currently applied to the device and uses that first).
